# Chip-8 Emulator in Rust

This is a simple Chip-8 emulator implemented in Rust. The Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language used in the development of early video games. This emulator allows you to run and play Chip-8 ROMs on your computer.


## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, follow the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chip8-emulator-rust.git
    cd chip8-emulator-rust
    ```

3. **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    cargo run --release
    ```
